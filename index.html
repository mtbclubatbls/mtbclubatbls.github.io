      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div>
        <p>At the Boston Latin School MTB club, you will learn how to ride a mountain bike. You will hit jumps, send down tech trails, shralp berms, and zoom down flow trails. We have varied meeting spots and times. The google form says meetings on Friday at 4:00 PM, but we will normally meet on Saturdays and Sundays at these locations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Southern entrance to Cutler Park on Great Plain Avenue</li>
          <li>Millenium Park, at the entrance by the soccer fields</li>
          <li>Hale Reservation in Westwood</li>
          <li>Velosolutions Pump Track in Allston next to Smith Playground</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pump track looks like a <a href="./pumpTrack">massive heap of black and blue asphalt with sections of grass in the middle</a>. If you are interested in joining, join our google hangout using the instructions below or the link at the top of the page. You can also contact us at mtbclubatbls@gmail.com (preferrably with a personal gmail account, as school accounts may not be able to reach this email address). We also have a Youtube channel where we will post some videos of our meets. You can check it out with the link <a href="#youtube">below</a>.</li>

        <p>Contact wpadgett@bostonk12.org or cgehring@bostonk12.org to request to join the google hangout (it's actually a google chat now because that's what google replaced google hangouts with, and joining by link is either blocked for BPS accounts, or they removed the feature that lets people join using a link, which is why we have to manually add you).</p>
