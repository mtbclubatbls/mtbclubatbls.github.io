        <h3><span id="hangout">Join the Google Hangout</span></h3>
        <p>Contact wpadgett@bostonk12.org or cgehring@bostonk12.org to request to join the google hangout (it's actually a google chat now because that's what google replaced google hangouts with, and joining by link is either blocked for BPS accounts, or they removed the feature that lets people join using a link, which is why we have to manually add you).</p>
