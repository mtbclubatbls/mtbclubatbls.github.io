    <h1>BLS Mountain Biking Club</h1>
    <p>Hosted by Carl Gehring</p>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>Join the club. It's cool. Seriously though, it is. Learn to hit jumps, zoom over tech, pump rollers, and just <b><i>send it</i></b>. Usually meetings will be on early Sunday afternoons. It might say that they are on Friday after school, but there aren't really any mountain biking spots in the city. The places where meetings will happen are varied. Some of the spots include...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cutler Park Reservation</li>
      <li>Hale Reservation</li>
      <li>Millenium Park</li>
      <li>Vesolutions Pump Track</li>
      <li>(Possibly Natick Dirt Jumps and Wompatuck State Park)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As they go, mountain bikes are typically bikes that look like this and have exorbitant price tags (An entry level bike is typically $400+).</p>

    <p>If you have something that looks like that, great. If you don't have a bike, my family has a couple of spares (a small, maybe two mediums, and a large).</p>
